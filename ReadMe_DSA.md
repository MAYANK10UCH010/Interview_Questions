## Difference Between Concatenate and Append (Advanced Data Structures)

When dealing with tuples, strings, queues, and linked lists, the difference between concatenation and appending becomes crucial in terms of <b>time complexity, memory usage, and <b> underlying data structure behavior.

| Data Structure  | Concatenation | Appending |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Tuples** | Creates a new tuple by merging two tuples, leading to O(n) time complexity. | Tuples are immutable, so appending requires creating a new tuple, also O(n). |
| **Strings** | Generates a new string as strings are immutable, with O(n) complexity. | Similar to concatenation, appending requires creating a new string, also O(n). |
| **Queues** | Requires merging two queues, which may involve O(n) complexity. | Typically O(1) when using a linked list or deque structure. |
| **Linked Lists** | Involves traversing and modifying pointers, typically O(n) for singly linked lists but O(1) for doubly linked lists. | Usually O(1) if appending at the tail, especially in doubly linked lists. |

> **Note:** The efficiency of concatenation vs. appending depends on the underlying data structure and implementation.
