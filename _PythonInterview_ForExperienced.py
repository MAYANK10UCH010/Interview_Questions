"""
numpy.array is more flexible than a Python list because it is optimized for numerical computations and offers several key advantages:

1. Efficiency & Performance
Memory Efficiency: numpy.array is stored in a contiguous memory block, while Python lists store references to objects, leading to higher memory overhead.

Faster Computation: NumPy operations are implemented in C, making them significantly faster than looping over lists in Python.

2. Vectorized Operations
NumPy supports element-wise operations directly, avoiding the need for explicit loops:
    
3. Broadcasting
NumPy allows arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes without explicit looping: 
    
    4. Support for Multi-Dimensional Arrays
NumPy supports matrices and higher-dimensional arrays:

1. Debugging a Python Program
# By using this command we can debug a python program

Answer:

python -m pdb python-script.py

2. Yield Keyword in Python
The keyword in Python can turn any function into a generator. Yields work like a standard return keyword.

3. Converting a List into a String
When we want to convert a list into a string, we can use the <.join()> method which joins all the elements into one and returns as a string.

"""

days=['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St']
ltos=' '.join(days)

print(type(days))
print(type(ltos))
print(ltos)

"""
Question 

4. Converting a List into a Tuple
By using Python <tuple()> function we can convert a list into a tuple. But we canâ€™t change the list after turning it into tuple, because it becomes immutable.

"""
days=['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St']
ltos=tuple(days)


Dicdays={'S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St'}
print(type(Dicdays))
print(type(days))
print(type(ltos))
print(ltos)


"""
Comments:
    
    look at the brackets while converting from list to tuple and set
    I think set and dictionary can be related

"""
5. Converting a List into a Set
    
    User can convert list into set by using <set()> function.
"""

days=['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St']
ltos=set(days)

print(ltos)
print(type(ltos))

"""
6. Counting the occurrences of a particular element in the list
    We can count the occurrences of an individual element by using a <count()> function.
    
6.1. Counting the occurrences of elements in the list

days = ['S','M','W', 'M','M','F','S']

7. Creating a NumPy Array in Python

    NumPy arrays are more flexible then lists in Python
