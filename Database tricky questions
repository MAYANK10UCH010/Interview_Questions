Question1: here important thingg is to remeber is the order of execution for case statement else it will give error or test cases will fail.

select 
case 
    when a+b<=c or b+c<=a or a+c<=b then 'Not A Triangle'
    when  a=b and b=c  then 'Equilateral'
    when a=b or b=c or a=c then 'Isosceles'
    
else 'Scalene'
end as Triangle_Type 
from triangles;
