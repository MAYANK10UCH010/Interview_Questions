<h3> Question 1: What are Python decorators and how would you use them? </h3>


## Understanding "Extend Past Python"

<p>
The phrase <i>"extend past Python"</i> suggests that the concept of decorators is not exclusive to Python but exists in other programming languages as well. It implies that similar functionality—where functions take other functions as arguments and return modified functions—can be found in other paradigms, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Higher-order functions</b> in functional programming languages (e.g., Haskell, JavaScript with <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>reduce</code>).</li>
  <li><b>Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)</b>, which allows modifying function behavior dynamically (e.g., Java’s annotations with Spring AOP).</li>
  <li><b>Function wrappers</b> in JavaScript, such as middleware functions in Express.js.</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, the specific syntax of decorators using <code>@decorator_name</code> is Python-specific, whereas the general idea of functions modifying other functions (or classes) exists in multiple languages.

<h3> Question 2: What is PEP8 and do you follow its guidelines when you're coding? </h3>
<p> A coding standard, and I try to. pylint is a great help.</p> Pylint is an open-source tool designed to help developers check code and its quality, detect programming errors in the Python language and offer simple refactoring suggestions.

<h3> Question 3: How are arguments passed – by reference of by value? </h3> (easy, but not that easy, I'm not sure if I can answer this clearly)
<p> </p>

<h3> Question 4:Do you know what list and dict comprehensions are? Can you give an example? </h3>
<p> Ways to construct a list or dict through an expression and an iterable  </p>
