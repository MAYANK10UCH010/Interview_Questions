<h1>Python Interview Questions</h1>

<p>I'm about to go to my first Python interview and I'm compiling a list of all possible interview questions. Based on resources that I've found <a href="#">here</a>, <a href="#">here</a> and <a href="#">here</a>, I noted down the following common questions. What else should I add?</p>

<h2>Easy/Intermediate</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What are Python decorators and how would you use them?</li>
    <li>How would you set up many projects where each one uses different versions of Python and third-party libraries?</li>
    <li>What is PEP8 and do you follow its guidelines when you're coding?</li>
    <li>How are arguments passed â€“ by reference or by value?</li>
    <li>Do you know what list and dict comprehensions are? Can you give an example?</li>
    <li>Show me three different ways of fetching every third item in the list.</li>
    <li>Do you know what is the difference between lists and tuples? Can you give me an example for their usage?</li>

    <li>What's wrong with <code>import *</code>?</li>
    <li>Why is the GIL important?</li>
    <li>What are "special" methods (<code>&lt;foo&gt;</code>), how they work, etc.?</li>
    <li>Can you manipulate functions as first-class objects?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between <code>class Foo</code> and <code>class Foo(object)</code>?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tricky, Smart Ones</h2>
<ul>
    <li>How to read an 8GB file in Python?</li>
    <li>What don't you like about Python?</li>

</ul>

<h2>Subjective Ones</h2>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>Ok, so should I add something else or is the list comprehensive?</p>
